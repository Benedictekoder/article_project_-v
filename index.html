         <h3>Facts</h3>
          <p>The Amanita family consists of over 600 species.
           Some are deadly poisonous if eaten, and others are edible.
           Amanitas can be found across every continent except for the north and southpole. Common caracteristics include white flesh, white gills under the cap, a "skirt" around its stipe (stem) and a bulbenous sack (volva) from which its fruiting body arises.</p>
